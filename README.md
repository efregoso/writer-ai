# Writer.AI

Writer.AI is a work-in-progress web application for creative writers
that integrates AI in ways that **facilitate the creative writing process,
versus creative OVER-writing**.  As a writer myself, I have seen a lot
of authors in the community worried about the impact of "AI writing" on
flesh-and-bone authors.  But AI can be an extremely powerful tool for us, 
particularly when integrated into the creative process as an "editor",
"beta reader", or "fact consultant", without allowing it too much
creative liberty over the work.

My goal is to make this application run locally using AI models offered
on the internet, so **none of the author's input is being used to train any 
of the AI models involved,** protecting the creative integrity of your work.  


Planned features include:

* **Side-by-side browser integration** for note-taking and fact-checking
* **Built-in dictionary and thesaurus** on word highlight or lookup
* **Optional next-word suggestions**
* **AI beta reader**, including **writing flow, style, fact-checking, and**
**continuity analysis**
* **Save notes / pics**, organize them into folders
* **Character / Plot / Location Bibles**
* **Spotify playlist integration** for accessing your writing playlists
* **Search** saved notes, files, and story bible entries
* **Export as PDF, TXT, or DOCX**
* **Pop-out widget** for continued writing without focusing on the web window
